            <p>The following upgrade steps are needed if you want to upgrade your
                project from Mod4j 1.0.1 to Mod4j
                1.1.0.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Open Eclipse and un-install all the previous installed Mod4j
                        Eclipse features.</li>
                    <li>
                        Now you can install the new version (1.1.0) of the Mod4j Eclipse
                        features via the Mod4j update site:

            <subsection name="Remove hand-written applicationContext.xml files">
                <p>The generation of Spring configuration files has changed. A file named 'applicationContext.xml' is now
                generated in 'generated-resources' followed by the package root directory for each module. In the previous
                versions a file with the same name was generated just once under 'src/main/resources'. This last file will
                conflict on the classpath with the generated one. The file 'applicationContext.xml' under 'src/main/resources'
                will have to be removed.
