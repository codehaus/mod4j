                Mod4j is a project that focuses on Model Driven Software Development. It's goal is to improve the
                productivity of Java software development by using Domain Specific Languages.

            <subsection name="Getting started">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make sure you've installed Java JDK version 5 (1.5.0_15 or higher). You can download one from
                        the
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun download site</a>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://mod4j.smart-java.nl/docs/downloads">Download</a>
                        and install Eclipse with modeling plug-ins. To minimize time spending on version en dependency
                        conflicts we already have a version waiting for you to download. This version based on Eclipse
                        Europa 3.3.2, OAW 4.3, EMF 2.3.1 and has some convenient plug-ins (like Q4E and Subclipse). You
                        can download a Windows or Linux archive from our project share
                        <a href="https://mod4j.smart-java.nl/docs/downloads">here</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure you start Eclipse with de right options, e.g on a linux system:
                        /path-to-eclipse-mod4j/Eclipse-europa/eclipse -vm /path-to-jdk1.5.0_15/jre/bin/java -vmargs
                        -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure the text file encoding in Eclipse is set to 'UTF-8'. You can verify and set this in
                        the field 'Text file encoding' by navigating to 'Window -> Preferences... -> General ->
                        Workspace'. For Linux users UTF-8 is usually the platform encoding, and no change will be
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>Install the DSL-editors as described in the next section.</li>
                </ol>

            <subsection name="Installing the DSL-editor Eclipse plugins">
                <p>
                    The DLS-editors can be installed from the Mod4j update site:
                    <big>Mod4j update site: https://mod4j.smart-java.nl/updates</big>
                </p>

            <subsection name="Modelling">
                <p>If you've completed the installation steps above, you're ready for moddeling...</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First of all you need to create a new Eclipse project for each DSL you're going to use.
                        <br />
                        For instance if you want to create a BusinessDomain model, choose:
                        <q>File, New, Project, Xtext DSL Wizzards, BusinessDomainDSL project</q>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>TODO More steps</li>
                    <li>
                        The previous step generated two modules into the RecordShop-Application folder. See:
                        <code>../RecordShop-Application/RecordShop-domain</code>
                        and
                        <code>../RecordShop-Application/RecordShop-data</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
