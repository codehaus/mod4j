        <section name="Welcome to Mod4j">
            <p>
                Mod4j is a project that focuses on Model Driven Software Development. It's goal is to improve the productivity
                and quality
                of Java software development by using Domain Specific Languages (DSL's).
            </p>
            <p>
                The DSL's and the corresponding code generators are based on a reference architecture. This allows developers to
                model various aspects of the application and generate code that strictly follows this reference architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reference architecture is described in a separate document which can be found at
                <a href="https://mod4j.smart-java.nl/docs/">https://mod4j.smart-java.nl/docs/</a>
                For a good understanding of the generated code it is useful to read this document.

                        Make sure you start Eclipse with de right jdk, e.g on a linux system:
                        <q>/path-to-eclipse-mod4j/Eclipse-europa/eclipse -vm

                    <li>
                        Make sure the text file encoding in Eclipse is set to 'UTF-8'. You can verify and set this in the field
                        'Text file encoding' by navigating to 'Window -> Preferences... -> General -> Workspace'. For Linux
                        users UTF-8 is usually the platform encoding, and no change will be necessary.

                <p>If you've completed the installation steps above, you're ready for moddeling...</p>
                <p>
                    You can create the following Mod4j models in your project:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <img src="images/mod4j-business.ico" align="left" alt="" />
                    BusinessDomain model

                    DataContract model

                    Presentation model -- NOT AVAILABLE YET
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First of all you need to create a new Eclipse project for the Mod4j DSL models you are going to create.
                        <br />
                        For instance if you want to create a new BusinessDomain model, choose:
                        <q>File, New, Project, Xtext DSL Wizards, Mod4j BusinessDomainDSL project</q>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter the Application name of the project. For instance:
                        <b>MyApplication</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter a Root package. For instance:
                        <b>org.mycompany.myapplication</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uncheck the "Use default location" checkbox and choose a location where all model projects and modules
                        for your application can be placed.
                        <br />
                        While your project develops over time, this folder will contain the project modules you create: all
                        generated project modules and the generated Maven parent-pom.
                        <br />
                        We suggest (commonly used) you use the following folder structure:
                        <br />
                        <code>
                            <b>path-to-your-projects/MyApplication/modules</b>
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After finishing the wizard, a new project is created with the name
                        <b>MyApplication-dslModels</b>
                        and a directory structure like this:
                        <br />
                        <code>
                            <b>src/model/BusinessDomain/SampleModel.busmod</b>
                        </code>
                        (the model file containing the elements of your businessdomain model)
                        <br />
                        <code>

                        (the model file containing the elements of your datacontract model)
                        <br />

                            <b>src/model/service/SampleModel.sermod</b>
                        </code>
                        (the model file containing the elements of your service model)
                        <br />
                        <code>
                            <b>src/model/mod4j.properties</b>
                        </code>
                        (the property file containing input parameters for code generation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For modeling the businessdomain model of your application, open the file
                        <code>src/model/businessDomain/SampleModel.busmod</code>
                        with the
                        <code>BusinessDomain Model Editor</code>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>Here you can add the classes, attributes, businessrules, associations etc. of your BusinessDomain
                        model. See the usermanual for more information about how to setup your BusinessDomain model.</li>
                    <li>You can setup your DataContract- and Service model in the same way. </li>
                    <li>
                        After saving your models in Eclipse, the (re)sources for your application are automatically generated.
                        See
                        next section.
                    </li>

            <subsection name="Generating source code">
                <p>
                    If you've completed and saved your model(s) as described in the previous section, the source code and
                    resources for your application are automatically generated out of the model(s). Here below is described were
                    you can find them and how to import them as projects into Eclipse. You can also find a overview and the
                    location of the generated sources by opening the Mod4j "Generated Files" console. (Window > Show View >
                    Other > Mod4j > Generated Files).
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As you can see in the figure above, the BusinessDomain model generates (re)sources into two modules: the
                        -data and -domain module.
                        If these modules does not exist the modules will be automatically created.
                        The
                        <b>-domain</b>
                        and
                        <b>-data</b>
                        modules are created in the application folder for all your modules, right beside the
                        <code>MyApplication.dslModels</code>
                        folder. See:
                        <code>../MyApplication-domain</code>
                        and
                        <code>../MyApplication-data</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The generated sources are placed in the
                        <code>generated-sources</code>
                        and
                        <code>generated-resources</code>
                        folders
                        <code>MyApplication-domain/generated-sources</code>
                        and resources in
                        <code>MyApplication-data/generated-resources</code>
                        <br />
                        All Extension Points (see also next section) are initially generated into the
                        <code>src/main/..</code>
                        folders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the generated modules are fully Mavenized you can import the generated modules as Maven projects
                        into Eclipse. But before ypu do that, it's a good practice to install the also generated Maven
                        parent-pom first.
                        <br />
                        Open a command console and navigate to location of the generated parent-pom (it's the pom.xml in the
                        root of your application folder).
                        <br />
                        type:
                        <code>
                            <b>mvn clean install</b>
                        </code>
                        <br />
                        After the build is finished and you've seen "BUILD SUCCESFULL", the parent-pom and submodules are
                        locally installed and you can import the modules as Maven projects into Eclipse. If you run Maven for
                        the first time, it could take a few minutes to complete for downloading the needed dependencies.
                        <br />
                        Choose: Import, Maven 2, Maven 2 Project

                    There are several reasons to mention why a developer needs to manually add (re)sources to the generated
                    (re)sources by Mod4j.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To implement business rules</li>
                    <li>TODO</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For these reasons with Mod4j you can use Extension Points. Extension Points are extends to the generated
                    (re)sources and provide a place where developers manually can make additions to- or change the behavior of
                    the system. Initially Mod4j generates Extension Points once if they do not exist already. So Extension
                    Points will not be overwritten by the generator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically Extension Points are placed under the
                    <code>src</code>
                    folder of a module and needs to be added to the projects versioncontrol system.
