            <p>
                Mod4j is a project that focuses on Model Driven Software Development. It's goal is to improve the productivity
                and quality of enterprise Java software development by using Domain Specific Languages (DSL's).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mod4j DSL's and the corresponding code generators are based on a reference architecture. This allows
                developers to
                model various aspects of the application and generate code that strictly follows this reference
                architecture.
                The reference architecture is described in a separate document. For a good understanding of the
                generated code it is useful to read this document ->
                <a href="documentation-parent/application-architecture/mod4j-application-architecture.pdf">PDF</a> or
                <a href="documentation-parent/application-architecture/mod4j-application-architecture.html">HTML</a>
